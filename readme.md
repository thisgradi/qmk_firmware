# MIDI 88 fork for Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

Changes:
* (.gitmodules) lib/lufa url changed to custom fork of LUFA, that has â€ŽProjects/MIDIToneGenerator/MIDIToneGenerator.h modified to have different BASE_FREQUENCY (27.5 -> 8.1758), and BASE_PITCH_INDEX (21 -> 0);
* keyboards/bfb/midi88 folder added, containing keyboard-specific files;
* data/constants/keycodes received a new file: keycodes_0.0.3_midi.hjson that contains additional keycodes and moves the existing ones. It is used for the next step;
* quantum/keycodes.h regenerated using the ./util/regen.sh utility, and swapping the existing keycodes.h with the generated one;
* quantum/process_keycode/process_midi.c calculates midi_config.octave as QK_MIDI_OCTAVE_2 - MIDI_OCTAVE_MIN in stock. This was changed to MI_OCN1 - MIDI_OCTAVE_MIN. The calculated value is used to get the correct tones.
* quantum/quantum_keycodes.h redefined MIDI_TONE_MIN, MIDI_TONE_MAX to include all the additional note keycodes.
